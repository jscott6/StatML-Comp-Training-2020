# Problems

This folder contains a description of three problems that can be attempted during the class. The first is building a package which provides the Gibbs sampler described [here](Gibbs_sampler.pdf). 

There are also two Rcpp based problems. The [first](gibbs_rcpp.md) of which involves refactoring the aforementioned Gibbs sampler into a C++ version, and calling this sampler from R using Rcpp attributes.
The [second](linkedlist.md) (and more challenging) task is to *create a basic linked list datastructure* in C++, and expose it to R using Rcpp modules.
