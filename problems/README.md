# Problems

This folder contains a description of two problems to be attempted during the class. 
The first problem involves refactoring a Gibbs sampler implemented in R into a C++ version, and calling this sampler from R using Rcpp attributes.
The second, more challenging problem, involves creating a basic linked list datastructure in C++, and exposing it to R using Rcpp modules.
