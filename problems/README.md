# Problems

This folder contains a description of two problems to be attempted during the class. 
The first involves *refactoring a Gibbs sampler* implemented in R into a C++ version, and calling this sampler from R using Rcpp attributes.
The second, more challenging task is to *create a basic linked list datastructure* in C++, and expose it to R using Rcpp modules.
